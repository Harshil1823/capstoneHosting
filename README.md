## Running

### Access to the App's web page

Open your web browser and go to <http://localhost:3000/> to view the app.

# Deployment

To deploy this web application, ensure you have Node.js and MongoDB installed on your system. First, clone the repository and install dependencies using npm install. Set up a .env file to store sensitive information like database connection strings (do not include passwords in Git). Use a cloud platform like Render. Deploy your database using MongoDB Atlas or another cloud database service. Finally, push your code to a GitHub repository and connect it to your hosting platform for automatic deployment. If needed, configure environment variables in the hosting platformâ€™s dashboard.

# Testing

We have set up automated unit and behavioral tests for our application:

### Unit Testing 

* To run the unit tests, use the following command:

    ```bash
    npm test
    ```

* Unit tests are located in our `/tests/` directory

### Behavioral Testing

To run the behavioral tests, follow these steps:

1. Open another terminal, navigate to the project directory, and run the commands in the [Setup](#setup) portion.

2. Run the Cypress Test Runner in a second terminal:

    ```bash
    npm run cy:open
    ```

3. Once the Cypress window opens, click the **End to End Testing** button. If not previously configured, it should run a configuration command.

4. Choose a desired browser (we recommend either **Electron** or **Chrome**) and click **"Start End to End Testing"**.

5. Choose any of the files titled `*Test.cy.js` to run a specific test. Make sure the application is running in another terminal per Step 1.

* Behavioral tests are located in our `/cypress/e2e/` directory

## Testing Technology

### Jest

* Unit testing was accomplished using [Jest](https://jestjs.io)

  To install Jest, use the following command:

    ```bash
    npm install --save-dev jest
    ```

### Cypress

* Behavioral testing was accomplished using [Cypress](https://www.cypress.io/)

  To install Cypress, use the following command:

    ```bash
    npm install --save-dev cypress
    ```

## Running Tests

### Jest (Unit Testing)

* To run the unit tests, use the following command:

    ```bash
    npm test
    ```

### Cypress (Behavioral Testing)

To run the behavioral tests, follow these steps:

1. Open another terminal, navigate to the project directory, and run the commands in the [Setup](#setup) portion.

2. Run the Cypress Test Runner in a second terminal:

    ```bash
    npm run cy:open
